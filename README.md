# TruthLens-AI
An AI-Powered Fake Content Detector for Social Media


**Overview**<br>
The AI-Generated Image Detection Model can help you determine if an image was entirely generated by an AI model, or if it is a real image. This model was trained on millions of artificially-created and human-created images spanning all sorts of content such as photography, art, drawings, memes and more.<br>
<br>
The Model works by analyzing the visual (pixel) content of the image. No meta-data is used in the analysis. Tampering with meta-data such as EXIF data therefore has no effect on the scoring.
<br><br>
The Model was trained to detect images generated by the main models currently in use: Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion XL, MidJourney, Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Flux, Recraft, GANs... Additional models will be added over time as they become available.
